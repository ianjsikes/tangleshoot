# tangleshoot

Attempting to make a very basic multiplayer game in Rust + WebAssembly using Bevy and [Tangle](https://github.com/kettle11/tangle).

## Running Locally

You will need Rust and Node installed. I'm using [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a task runner, so you'll need to `cargo install just` if you want to run the tasks in `./justfile`. You can run them with the command `just` to compile everything and `just serve` to start a dev server. Alternatively, just copy and run the commands from `./justfile` directly into your shell.
